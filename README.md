# 🌸 Calma – Your Pocket Space for Mental Wellness

**Live Site:** [nourhanhosnyy.github.io/calma](https://nourhanhosnyy.github.io/calma)

Calma is a peaceful and minimal mental wellness app concept. This landing page showcases a fictional mobile app designed to support emotional clarity and calm through features like guided journaling, breathing exercises, mood tracking, and quick notes.

This project helped me practice responsive layouts, visual storytelling, and emotional branding using only **HTML & CSS**.
